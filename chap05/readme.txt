Note:  The form file has both a topmenu and a toolbar
defined and commented out.  Compiling the form file in
its default format illustrates a form with the default
button position.  Change the form file to uncomment
the toolbar or the topmenu and recompile the form to see
how the form changes.  You do not need to recompile the 
program modules.
